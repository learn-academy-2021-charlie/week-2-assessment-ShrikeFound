## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. React: a front-end javascript library that helps us build resuable, dynamic components.

2. React lifecycle methods: methods that we can use to run code at specifics points in the mounting,updated, or unmounting of a component.

3. React state: is an object that holds information that can be updated or remain consistent as components update

4. Component invocation/call: coming back to this one...

5. DOM Events: DOM events are things that happen on the HTML document (I think? I never really thought about where the events actually happen), like something being clicked, or a key being pressed. These can be registed by javascript through event listeners, and then we can do things with the information from those events.
